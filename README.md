Overview
As a software engineer looking to further my data analysis and programming skills, I have been working on a project to analyze product reviews and ratings from Amazon. This analysis will help uncover patterns in customer feedback and product pricing, as well as determine which product categories are the most highly rated. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the relationships between pricing, discounts, ratings, and product categories to make data-driven decisions.

The dataset I am analyzing contains information on over 1,000 Amazon products, including product details like prices, categories, ratings, and reviews. This data was sourced from Kaggle's Amazon Sales Dataset.

I am writing this software to explore the data, answer key questions, and build useful insights that can be applied in real-world data analysis scenarios.

Data Analysis Results
Here are the questions I investigated, along with their answers:

What is the distribution of product prices?

Most products are priced below $20,000, with a mean price of $5,447 and a median of $1,650. The pricing distribution is highly skewed, with some high-priced outliers.

Which product categories have the highest average ratings?

Which product categories are rated the lowest?

Categories such as Electric Coffee Grinders (3.3) and PC Headsets (3.5) tend to receive lower ratings, suggesting that these products may have quality or design issues.

Development Environment
I used Google Colab for developing the software, leveraging its cloud-based environment to work with the dataset. The following tools and libraries were used:

Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.

Libraries:

Pandas: For data cleaning and analysis.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For visualizing the data and creating charts.

Useful Websites
These websites were particularly helpful in completing this project:

Future Work
In the future, I plan to:

Improve the data cleaning process to handle any missing or incorrect values.

Implement a recommendation system based on product ratings and reviews.

Explore more complex analyses like customer segmentation or sentiment analysis of product reviews.
